# SLAMTEC-RPLIDAR-A2M12-Performance-Evaluation-Project
In the SLAMTEC RPLIDAR A2M12 performance evaluation project, I conducted experimental assessments of LiDAR accuracy, resolution, and detection range, 
							  analyzing its impact on the Leo Rover's SLAM and obstacle avoidance capabilities. I identified key limitations, including distance miscalculations, 
							  environmental noise interference, and vertical blind spots, and proposed multi-sensor fusion and algorithmic optimizations as improvement strategies. 
							  This experience enhanced my skills in robot perception, SLAM, sensor data analysis, and experimental evaluation, deepening my understanding of LiDAR-based mapping 
							  and autonomous navigation systems.
